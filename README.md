1. Vishwa Belpu, Personal: vishwa.belpu@gmail.com, WakeTech: vrbelpu@my.waketech.edu
2. I plan to use my GitHub account to show what I'm currently working on and what I plan to work on after the course ends. Currently I haven't uploaded anything to the GitHub repository since I haven't started on any projects yet.
3. This repository is going to be used to complete the assignments that I get assigned in the WakeTech course that Mr. Roark assigns me on a daily day to day basis. I've kept a seperate repository for any of my own personal projects that I have.
4. In order to clone the repository onto my desktop, I went to the file section where it gives the option to clone a repository straight from the web version of GitHub. Once I clicked the clone repository from GitHub.com, it gave the option of choosing which repository I wanted to clone. In this case, I chose the github.io repository to upload my work.

#About Me

##My Interests
    -My First interest includes doing car photography, as I started back in 2022. I've taken picutes of several rare cars, including several Ferraris, McLarens, Lamborghinis, and Porsches. Some of my rarest photos include a photo of the latest Porsche 935, a Ferrari F40, two Ford GTs from 2006-8, and as of recently, a Porsche Carrera GT.
    -Another interest of mine includes participating in my School's FBLA team, where I'm a member who wants to helps his teamates win their categories. Last year, I ran for the presidential position but didn't win, but that still didn't stop me from wanting to compete and go to states this year.
    -After I get a degree, I want to help with the coding and creation of AI tools that can help businesses be able to automate their operations. 

##Websites I recommend
    - [Exclusive Car Registry] (https://exclusivecarregistry.com/) - This website can be used to track down the current status and location of several rare cars in the world, ranging from Porsche GT3RS all the way to McLaren F1s. It's a cool website that was made very recently it seems.
    - [Instagram] (https://www.instagram.com/) - I find Instagram very interesting because of the fact that it allows people to keep others updated about their personal life as well as share interesting places they've been to. I use Instagram to post my car photos as well as the places that I've been to. Over the summer, I went to Canada and got to share a picture of a glacier on top of a mountain.
