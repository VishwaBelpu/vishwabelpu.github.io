1. Vishwa Belpu, Personal: vishwa.belpu@gmail.com, WakeTech: vrbelpu@my.waketech.edu
2. I plan to use my GitHub account to show what I'm currently working on and what I plan to work on after the course ends. Currently I haven't uploaded anything to the GitHub repository since I haven't started on any projects yet.
3. This repository is going to be used to complete the assignments that I get assigned in the WakeTech course that Mr. Roark assigns me on a daily day to day basis. I've kept a seperate repository for any of my own personal projects that I have.
4. In order to clone the repository onto my desktop, I went to the file section where it gives the option to clone a repository straight from the web version of GitHub. Once I clicked the clone repository from GitHub.com, it gave the option of choosing which repository I wanted to clone. In this case, I chose the github.io repository to upload my work.
